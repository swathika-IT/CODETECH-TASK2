Overview of the project:

PROJECT: DATA STRUCTURES IMPLEMENTATION

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this code is to create a menu-driven program that allows users to interact with three different data structures: Linked Lists, Binary Trees, and Graphs.

KEY ACTIVITIES:

1. The program presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose which data structure they want to interact with.
  
2. Based on the user's choice, the program provides a submenu with specific operations that can be performed on the chosen data structure.

3. The user can perform operations such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, printing the data structure, and more.
 
4. The program handles user input and provides feedback on the outcome of each operation.

TECHNOLOGY USED:

1. Programming Language: C
   
2. Development Environment: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC)
   
3. Data Structures: Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Graphs (implemented using adjacency matrices)
   
4. Input/Output: Standard input/output functions in C (scanf, printf)
   
5. Memory Management: Manual memory management using malloc and freeÂ functions.
